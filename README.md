Human Guided Data Harmonization

## Introduction
Harmonium is an application that can be used to perform guided ETL of research data from one format into another using a simple YAML configuration to manage the individual transforms. The intended workflow is that the user will build the basic relationships between the source data dictionary and the harmonized data dictionary using the Map Dragon web application. The mappings can then be used to build a basic transformation configuration which will then be tweaked by a human. Once that is ready, the same configuration can be reused to process the data over and over again for subsequent releases and updates. 

## Requirements
TBD
